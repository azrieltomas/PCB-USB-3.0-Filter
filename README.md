# PCB-USB-3.0-Filter
Simple USB 3.0 power filter

This is a simple power filter for use with USB 3.0 ports.
VBUS is filtered through a basic LC filter, data lines are all pass through.
My hope is this solves hum on external audio devices.

PCB created with EasyEDA

3D printable case created with FreeCAD

V1.0 uses two USB Type A female connectors
V2.0 streamlines the PCB, replaces one connector with USB Type A Male, to make it directly pluggable to PC / Equipment.

V2.0 Print Case TBD
